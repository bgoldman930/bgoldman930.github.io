			I will be joining Cornell University in 2025 as an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://economics.cornell.edu">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu">Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy</a>. Currently, I am a postdoc at Cornell University and a research affiliate at <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org">Opportunity Insights</a>, the <a href="https://leo.nd.edu">Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities</a>, and <a href="https://edredesign.org">EdRedesign</a>. My research focuses on labor and public economics, with an emphasis on race- and class-based economic disparities in the United States. I study the sources of these disparities and assess policies designed to mitigate them. I received my PhD from Harvard University in 2024.
