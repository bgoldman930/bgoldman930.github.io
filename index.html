			I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://economics.cornell.edu">Economics</a> and <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu">Public Policy</a> at Cornell University and a Research Principal at <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org">Opportunity Insights</a>. My research is in labor and public economics, with a focus on economic disparities by class and race in the United States. Much of my work examines the role of family formation in shaping these disparities. I am a research affiliate at the <a href="https://leo.nd.edu">Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities</a>, <a href="https://edredesign.org">EdRedesign</a>, and the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/cpc/">Cornell Population Center</a>. I received my PhD in Economics from Harvard University in 2024. I am also the quarterbacks coach for the Ithaca High School football team.
