			I will be joining Cornell University in July 2025 as an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://economics.cornell.edu">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu">Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy</a>. I am currently a postdoc at Cornell and a research affiliate at <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org">Opportunity Insights</a>, the <a href="https://leo.nd.edu">Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities</a>, the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/cpc/">Cornell Population Center</a>, and <a href="https://edredesign.org">EdRedesign</a>. My research lies at the intersection of labor and public economics, focusing on class- and race-based economic disparities in the United States, with particular attention to the role of family formation in shaping these gaps. I received my PhD from Harvard University in 2024.
