		<p> I am a PhD student in the economics department at Harvard University, a research affiliate at <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org">Opportunity Insights</a> and <a href="https://edredesign.org">EdRedesign</a>, 
			and a <a href="https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/phd-training">Stone Scholar</a> in Inequality and Wealth Concentration at Harvard Kennedy School.
			My research is primarily in labor and public economics with a focus on race- and class-based economic disparities in the US. 
			I study the sources of these disparities and evaluate policies that aim to alleviate them.

			Beginning in July, I will be an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://economics.cornell.edu">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu">Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy</a> at Cornell University.
