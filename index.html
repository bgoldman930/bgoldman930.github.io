			I am an Assistant Professor at Cornell University, with appointments in the <a href="https://economics.cornell.edu">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu">Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy</a>. I am also a research affiliate at <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org">Opportunity Insights</a>, the <a href="https://leo.nd.edu">Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities</a>, the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/cpc/">Cornell Population Center</a>, and <a href="https://edredesign.org">EdRedesign</a>. My research is in labor and public economics, with a focus on economic disparities by class and race in the United States. Much of my work examines the role of family formation in shaping these disparities. I received my PhD in Economics from Harvard University in 2024.
