		Americans rarely marry outside of their own race or class group. We use anonymized data covering nearly the entire U.S. population to study the sources of marital homophily by parental income, or “class,” and race, focusing on white-Black marriage. We distinguish between two explanations for marital homophily: a lack of exposure to people of different backgrounds versus a preference to marry within group. Despite similar levels of marital homophily by race and class, homophily by class is driven largely by residential segregation, whereas racial homophily is not. We analyze the role of residential segregation in partial equilibrium with an instrument for exposure based on race- and class-specific sex ratios in childhood neighborhoods. Increased exposure to opposite-sex members of other class groups leads to a substantial increase in interclass marriage, but increased exposure to other race groups has no detectable impact on white-Black interracial marriage. To quantify the impact of specific desegregation policies in general equilibrium, we develop and estimate a spatial model of the marriage market. Policies that reduce residential segregation can have large effects on interclass marriage with implications for the dynamics of income across generations.

		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		Communities in Schools (CIS) is a program that places a “navigator” in high-poverty schools who provides an integrated system of supports to students, including academic (e.g., tutoring), economic (e.g., access to food assistance, housing), and mentoring. In 2023, CIS worked with 1.8 million students in 3,750 schools. Using later-treated CIS schools as a control, we estimate that four years of exposure to CIS generates a $1,500 (6% of control mean) increase in earnings at age 30. Effects are larger for students from low-income families and are driven by a reduction in non-employment and an increase in the probability of having a low-paying job. Our results are robust to other choices of control groups, including a within family comparison of siblings. Each child exposed to four years of CIS is expected to pay an additional $10,000 in taxes between ages 18-65, which compares favorably to the program cost. Our results are relevant for the growing community school movement and illuminate a possible path for improving economic mobility in low opportunity neighborhoods.
