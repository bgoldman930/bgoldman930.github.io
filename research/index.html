		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		We study the mechanisms underlying recent trends in economic opportunity using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. We document four main results. First, there has been a substantial decline in the intergenerational mobility of white children born between 1978 and 1992, with improving outcomes for white children from high-income families and deteriorating outcomes for white children from low-income families. Outcomes for Black children have improved across all parental income levels in the same birth cohorts, leading to a declining Black-white earnings gap for children from low-income families and a stable Black-white earnings gap for children from high-income families. Second, changes in parental marital status, education, occupation, and wealth explain little of the declining race gap and expanding white class gap. Third, we observe nearly identical trends among children growing up in the same neighborhood, meaning that these changes also cannot be explained by city- or neighborhood-specific changes in economic opportunity. The few areas with stable outcomes for poor white children are also those where low-income white parents are most likely to have kept their jobs in recent decades. Fourth, quasi-experimental estimates based on children who move across counties show that there is a significant positive impact of growing up in an area where parental employment rates in one's social community are stable. We conclude by showing that nearly all of the declining race gap and expanding white class gap can be explained by differential changes in the average employment rates of parents by race and class. 	</details>

		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		We provide new evidence on the drivers of the early US coronavirus pandemic. We combine an epidemiological model of disease transmission with quasi-random variation arising from the timing of stay-at-home-orders to estimate the causal roles of policy interventions and voluntary social distancing. We then relate the residual variation in disease transmission rates to observable features of cities. We estimate significant impacts of policy and social distancing responses, but we show that the magnitude of policy effects is modest, and most social distancing is driven by voluntary responses. Moreover, we show that neither policy nor rates of voluntary social distancing explain a meaningful share of geographic variation. The most important predictors of which cities were hardest hit by the pandemic are exogenous characteristics such as population and density.

		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		This study uses worker-level data on industry, occupation, and place of work to explore differences in the spatial properties of production, administrative, and R&D occupation groups within industries. To measure differences, we calculate location quotients at the local labor market level and the Duranton and Overman (2005) agglomeration index for each group. We find appreciable differences in the spatial distribution of occupation groups within most manufacturing industries, with R&D occupations consistently exhibiting the highest degree of spatial concentration. Our results are consistent with the core theoretical and empirical results in the agglomeration literature.
