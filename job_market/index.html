        <p class="paper_title">Why do People Rarely Marry Outside Their Race or Class?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 11pt">(with Jamie Gracie and Sonya Porter)<br><i>Paper will be posted in November 2023</i></p>
        <p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px; text-align: justify; font-size: 11pt;">Americans rarely marry outside of their race or class group. We distinguish between two possible explanations: a lack of exposure to other groups versus a preference to marry within group. We develop an instrument for neighborhood exposure to opposite-sex members of other race and class groups using variation in sex ratios among nearby birth cohorts in childhood neighborhoods. This allows us to test whether increased exposure results in more interracial (white-Black) and interclass (top-to-bottom parent income quartile) marriages. We find increased exposure to opposite-sex members of other class groups generates a substantial increase in interclass marriage, but exposure across race lines has no detectable effect on interracial marriage. We use these results to estimate a spatial model of the marriage market and quantify the impact of reducing segregation in general equilibrium. Our model suggests that most of the cross-commuting zone relationship between interclass marriage and segregation is due to the causal effect of segregation. Policies that reduce segregation will do little to increase rates of interracial marriage but can have large effects on interclass marriage.</p>
