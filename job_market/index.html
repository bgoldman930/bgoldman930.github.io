<p class="paper_title">Why People Rarely Marry Outside Their Race and Class <span style="font-size: 11pt">(with Jamie Gracie and Sonya Porter)<br><i>&nbsp;  Paper will be posted in November 2023</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px; text-align: justify; font-size: 11pt;">Americans rarely marry outside of their race or class group. We distinguish between two possible explanations for this: a lack of exposure to other groups versus a preference to marry within group. We focus on white-Black marriage and marriages between individuals from families in the top and bottom quartiles of the parent income distribution. We begin by showing that people often marry near-neighbors of similar age who live close to their childhood neighborhood. We draw on this fact to develop an instrument for exposure to opposite-sex members of other groups based on sex ratios among nearby birth cohorts in childhood neighborhoods. Increased exposure to other class groups generates a substantial increase in interclass marriage, but exposure across race lines has no detectable impact on interracial marriage. We use these results to estimate a spatial model of the marriage market and quantify the impact of reducing segregation in general equilibrium. Our model suggests that most of the cross-commuting zone relationship between interclass marriage and segregation is due to the causal effect of segregation. Policies that reduce segregation will do little to increase rates of interracial marriage but can have large effects on interclass marriage, with important implications for income dynamics across generations.</p>
